# Hello 👋 I am brennan k.a. pollock

## Full Stack Software Engineer

With a passion for creating pixel-perfect interfaces that users actually enjoy, I've spent the last 6+ years helping build systems that makes a difference. I thrive in collaborative environments where design meets functionality. When I'm not coding in TypeScript or Swift, I'm probably experimenting with new technologies or tinkering with my home server. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the code and the people who use it.
